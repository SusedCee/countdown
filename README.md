This app is a countdown for events.

The main technologies used are React Native, which uses Native code to build an app that will work in both iOS and Android. Some other technologies used was moment, uuid and Expo.

Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React. I used it as an iPhone immulator to check updates and as a debugging tool.


All code was made following the React Native: Getting Started by Hendrick Swanepoel course on Pluralsight. There are some differences between my code and the course code, since there has been some updates on package versions since the course was created.

For being my first React Native app, I got to learn a lot about not just React Native, but also Expo which has many helpful tools and ways to connect an API and design an app.
